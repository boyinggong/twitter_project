# Methodology
Methodology: we first divided the data by gender and winners/losers,
 and compared how many the nominees tweeted per day before and after the Globes.
The x-axis in the plots below is the time difference in days from the Globes.
For y-axis, we took median of the tweet counts when they were aggregated by gender and winners/losers.
The horizontal lines in the plots are the means of each values in before/after the globes to better compare them over pre and post.

# Some points to point to graph of male
For losers, we can conclude that, unexpectedly, the means of tweet counts per day increases as the Globes awarded,

We can clearly see that winners tweeted more right after the globes.


# Some points to point to graph of female
It is very clear that we can find an explicit spike right after the Globe in winners.

Also the winners tended to tweet more times on average after the golobes compared to before.
